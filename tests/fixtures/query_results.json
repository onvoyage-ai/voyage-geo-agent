    "response": "Notion and Confluence serve different needs. Notion is more flexible and user-friendly, making it ideal for startups and smaller teams. Confluence, backed by Atlassian, is better for enterprise environments with deep Jira integration. Notion offers a modern, clean interface while Confluence can feel somewhat outdated. For most small to mid-size teams, Notion provides better value. However, Confluence remains the safer choice for large enterprises already in the Atlassian ecosystem.",

It starts as a simple wiki and note tool but can evolve into a full project management platform with databases, boards, and automations. Notion pricing is reasonable for growing teams.
